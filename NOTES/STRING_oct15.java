        a string is a sequence of characters
        from the ascii table *UNICODE MR.I!!*
        the syntax used for string values is "" (double quotes)

        There are a varity of String methods...

        = = = = = Indexing & Len = = = = =
        every char of a string has an index value
        The index is the location of the character
        in the String.
        Indexes start at index 0

        Ex.    String name = "Thomas";
        index:                012345


        the length of a string is the number of characters it contains
        Ex.   String name = "Thomas";
        name.length();      =>      6

        Common String methods
            String thing = "Eli";
            thing.toUpperCase();        returns => "ELI"
            thing.toLowerCase();        returns => "eli"
            thing.charAt(a);            returns => the char at index a (int)
                thing.charAt(1);            => 'l'
            thing.indexOf(str);         returns => the index of the first occourence str
                                                returns => -1 if str isnt found;
                thing.indexOf(str, int);        starts looking at index int and after for the str    
            thing.substring();
