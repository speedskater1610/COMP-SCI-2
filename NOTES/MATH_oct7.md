becase they are static

-    Math.round(a) rounds to the nearest whole number traditionally
-    Math.ceil(a) rounds up to the next highest number
      - aways rounds up
-    Math.floor(a) rounds down
    - aways rounds down
-    Math.pow(a,b) takes 2 numbers and returns a to the power of b
-    Math.abs(a) returns the absolute value
-    Math.sqrt(a) returns the square root of a
-    Math.min(a,b) returns which number is smaller 
    - only 2 args at a time ;   return type depends on the args 
-    Math.max(a,b) returns the number that is larger 
    - only 2 numbers at a time
